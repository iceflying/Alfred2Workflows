###Workflows List:

- Media Key

    MediaKey is to set system volume and pause/play iTunes with hotkey on normal keyboard.

    It was developed because I cannot adjust system volume nor control iTunes with my mechanical keyboard.

    As default setting, HOME for increasing volume, END for decreasing, CMD-END for mute and PRTSC/SYSRQ for pause/play iTunes. However you can configure this workflow to use any key you want.

- GitHub Searcher

    GitHubSearcher is a tool to search repositories on GitHub and show the results in Alfred.

    The information contains Repository Full Name, Main Language and Description.
